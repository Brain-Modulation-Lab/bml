function [ ind, thres ] = bml_FDR( p_list, alpha, corrected )
% Computes the False Discovery Rate according to Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). 
% 
% Inputs: 
% p_list - list of p values
% alpha - the desired alpha threshold. Default: 0.05
% corrected - set to true if correction for dependencies is to be applied, according to Benjamini
% and Yekutieli (2001) (this is probably not the common case). 
%
% outputs:
% ind - the indexes of significant p-values within p_list
% thres - the p-value which served as the actual threshold in this test.
