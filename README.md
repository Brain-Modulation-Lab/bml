Matlab functions for ECoG/MER data manipulation and analysis
============================================================
Brain Modulation Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh

This repository provides functions for analysis and manipulation of ECoG, MER
and Audio data acquired in the Brain Modulation Laboratory (University of Pittsburgh).
These functions depend on, and extend, fieldtrip (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/).
They operate on FT_DATATYPE_RAW data structures and 'annotations tables'.
